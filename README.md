TXT File Merger is a simple Python script that merges multiple .txt files from a specified folder into a single output file. It reads all text files in the folder, combines their contents, and separates them with headers indicating the original filenames.
Features:

âœ… Merge all .txt files from a given folder
âœ… Preserve file order and separate contents with headers
âœ… User-friendly console input for folder selection and output file name
âœ… UTF-8 encoding support for compatibility with various text formats
Usage:

    Run the script:

    python gabung-txt.py

    Enter the folder path containing the .txt files.
    Enter the desired output file name.
    The script will generate a merged text file with all contents combined.

Example Output:

=== file1.txt ===
Content from file1...

=== file2.txt ===
Content from file2...
